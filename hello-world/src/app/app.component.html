<!--
    $event was used before in click events; representing a standard DOM event object

    This $event for custom events can be anything!

    If we pass a JS event object:
        this.change.emit({ newValue: this.isFavorite })
    
        The $event now represents that object
-->
<favorite [is-favorite]="post.isFavorite" (change)="onFavoriteChanged($event)"></favorite>
